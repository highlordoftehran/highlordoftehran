My name is Ashkan and I'm currently uploading some tutorial projects I'm doing while learning react (and ASP.Net Core to some extend) to build something of a resume for myself in the meantime, so please avoid looking at them and save me some dignity.

The day will come that I know enough to write something here that can benefit you. you may leave now.

Sincerely

HLoT
